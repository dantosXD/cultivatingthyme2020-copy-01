If you’re constantly getting sick, have low energy, or are having trouble losing weight, you may want to think about taking steps towards cleansing your lymphatic system.

The lymphatic system works with our heart to maintain the balance of blood and fluid in our body and plays a crucial role in recognizing toxins that could be harmful to our body, which triggers an immune response. Because the lymphatic system plays an essential role in our immune system, monitoring every substance that passes through and triggering an immune response, it deserves our attention just as much, if not more than other areas of our health and wellness.

When we support our lymphatic system’s circulation, we support our immunity and detoxification processes. 

Our lymphatic system depends on daily movement to help the lymph fluid flow through our body. 

Some ways that we can support lymphatic circulation include:

* Movement: Walking, yoga, running, swimming, stretching, and strength training. Our favorite is jumping on a trampoline or [rebounder](https://www.amazon.com/ANCHEER-Rebounder-Trampoline-Workout-Training/dp/B07D7TVQFF/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=rebounder&qid=1588789075&sr=8-3) and inversions.
* Food Focus: leafy greens, citrus fruits, & healthy fats
* Hydrate!
* Lymphatic self massages
