title: Healing vs. Curing
subtitle: Leah Foti
excerpt: >-
  Healing and curing are often used interchangeably, but their definitions are
  quite different. Healing is a natural process and within the power of
  everyone. Curing, which is what conventional medicine doctors are called upon
  to do, usually consists of an external treatment and medications that mask or
  eliminate symptoms.

Healing and curing are often used interchangeably, but their definitions are quite different. Healing is a natural process and within the power of everyone. Curing, which is what conventional medicine doctors are called upon to do, usually consists of an external treatment and medications that mask or eliminate symptoms. This external treatment doesn't necessarily address the factors that contributed to the symptoms in the first place. Healing goes deeper than curing and must always come from within.

> It’s the healer’s job to hold safe, sacred, non-judgmental space for the personal work patients will need to do while facing illness and using that illness as an opportunity for personal growth and spiritual awakening.

Healing addresses the imbalances at the base of the symptoms, the root cause. Healing is an integrative process that looks beyond the physical symptoms and explores mental, emotional, and spiritual wellness.

Committing to the healing process, even if a quick cure is available to you, is an active form of taking control of your own health. External treatments of conventional medicine typically require no conscious participation from the patient; they might recover, but may never heal the source of the illness.
