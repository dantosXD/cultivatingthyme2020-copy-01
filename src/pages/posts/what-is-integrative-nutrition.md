title: What is Integrative Nutrition?
subtitle: >-
  Do you feel like your body is a mystery? Do you feel stuck and overwhelmed? Do
  you feel like you’re “falling apart”? Are you comfortable in your own body?
  Are you at peace with yourself? What if I told you that, by eating real food,
  being active and practicing self-care, you can reduce risk of illness, build
  strength, increase energy, boost confidence and increase happiness.

Integrative Nutrition is a form of healing that looks at the whole person beyond the physical symptoms and body by addressing physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and intellectual health. All of these areas enable a person to truly live each day in the healthiest, happiest way possible, and if one area is compromised, most likely other areas will be as well.

When we focus on these five pillars of health and wellness, we can build from the inside out and discover what changes we need to implement in our lives to achieve our health goals; whether that is weight management, balancing hormones, improving gut health, healthy aging, the list goes on.

Cultivating Thyme Wellness Health Coaches are dedicated to leading their clients through their journey of self-discovery and helping them identify what areas need attention. We can build from the inside out and implement sustainable ways to achieve our client's individual health goals.
