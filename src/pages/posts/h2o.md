So many of us live in a constant state of searching for health. We all feel overwhelmingly tired and achy. We wonder why we have brain fog and blotchy skin. We have suffered from weight issues most of our lives and want to feel good. We also invest money in the newest supplements, and popular protein shakes, try different diets, sign up for gym membershipsâ€”all to little or no benefit.

So, what do we do? 

We start with small sustainable steps. What's our number one step? **DRINK MORE WATER**

We underestimate the benefits of drinking water because we've never taken the time to learn what water means to our bodies. We also don't like water because we have programmed our bodies to like tea, coffee, soda, juice, and everything BUT water.

If you automatically assume you're drinking enough water, without being intentional about how much you drink, then you probably aren't. Ideally, you should drink at least one ounce of water for every two pounds of body weight every day. To do this, take your body weight and divide it by two. If you live in a dry environment, you may need to drink more water. You also need to drink more water when you exercise to make up for what you lose when sweating.

Drinking water helps you stay focussed, gives you energy, improves skin health, and can help in aiding weight loss!

Drinking water aids in weight loss by:

* Speeding up your metabolism
* Helping you feel full (drink a glass of water before meals)
* Aids digestion

#### Things you can do to help yourself develop a good water drinking habit-

1. Take it with you

Carry a large re-useable water bottle with you whenever possible, avoiding plastic ones that contain potentially harmful BPA.

2. Set a timer

Set a timer on your phone for every 2 hours, drink a glass of water when it goes off. This is a great way to stay hydrated during busy days, especially during the Summer.

3. Add some flavor!

If you don't like the taste of water, adding squeezed lemon juice or cucumber slices and even herbs can be a great way to add flavor and nutrients!

4. Sick of water? Stock up on produce

Fruits and veggies such as watermelon, spinach, cucumber, strawberries, and oranges are made of mostly water and can keep you hydrated. 

5. Sip on soups and broths regularly

Try making soup  and broth at home! It's easy to do and allows you to include as many hydrating vegetables as you'd like. Avoid processed canned or boxed soups as they are often overly seasoned, extremely high in sodium.
