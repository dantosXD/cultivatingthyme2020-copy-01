      Co-Founders, Leah Foti, and Lani Geistwalker are dedicated to their
      client's health success by focusing on long-term lifestyle changes and
      treating the root cause rather than treating only symptoms.


      Our goal is to inspire and reconnect people with their mind, body, food,
      and Earth. Through clean, healthy, and seasonal recipes, sustainable
      lifestyle tips, and mindfulness practices, we hope to inspire an appetite
      for life, more profound awareness and appreciation for yourself, and the
      roots that connect us all.
